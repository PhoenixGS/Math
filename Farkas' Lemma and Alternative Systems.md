### Farkasâ€™ Lemma
Let $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$. The system $Ax = b, x \geq 0$ has a solution if and only if that $A^Ty \leq 0, b^T y > 0$ has no solution.
### Alternative System
Given matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$, exactly one of the following two systems is feasible:$$Ax\leq b$$or$$A^Ty=0,y\geq 0,b^Ty<0$$
### Gordan Theorem
Given matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, exactly one of the following two systems is feasible:$$Ax<0$$or$$y\geq 0,y\neq 0,A^Ty=0$$
